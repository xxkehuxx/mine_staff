**cashflows** is an open source (distributed under the MIT license) and friendly-user
package to do financial computations. The package was developed and tested in Python
version 3.6. It can be installed from the command line using:

**cashflows** can be used interactively at the Python’s command prompt, but a better
experience is achieved when IPython or Jupyter’s notebook are used, allows the
user to fully document the analysis and draw conclusions. Due to the design of
the package, it is easy to use cashflows with the tools available in the ecosystem
of open source tools for data science.

**cashflows** is well suited for many financial computations and it can be used to:

* Realize compound interest rate calculations.

* Converts between nominal, effective and periodic interest rates.
